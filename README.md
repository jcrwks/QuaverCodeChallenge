# QuaverCodeChallenge
* Interesting code challenge.  
* Hopefully, I did enough coding to fulfill the debugging skills challenge.  
* Wasn't quite sure how far to take this test with try/catch blocks etc.  
# Debugging Notes
* Wasn't sure the Github API was giving me different information at first.
* Thought I was getting the same information over and over.

* Also, wasn't sure if the mis-spellings were on purpose and part of the challenge.
* So don't take offense :-) if they were not part of the test.

# Thanks!
